## Introduction

Middle Eastern North African Theater Makers Alliance (MENATMA) is proud to launch the **MENA Theater Makers Fund**, a new national grant initiative supported by **Alternate ROOTS**, **National Association of Latino Arts and Cultures (NALAC)**, **First Peoples Fund**, and **The Wallace Foundation’s Advancing Wellbeing in the Arts initiative** and in partnership with the **National Arts Regranting Partners**. 

This program aims to serve as a catalyst for sustainability and innovation in the theater field, providing MENA cultural producers in the United States with critical funding to invest in their creative capacity to make lasting contributions to their communities and society. 

The MENA Theater Makers Fund offers general operating support and cohort-based engagement to under-resourced theater organizations that support and uphold MENA communities. Eligible theater organizations must have annual operating budgets of under $500,000. Through an open application process, MENATMA will award $800,000 in total funding, awarding $30,000 to $45,000 each in unrestricted funding to theater organizations across the U.S. 

Awardees will have access to additional funds to distribute to artists in their communities, selected by the awardee. More information to come.

## Program Objectives

* **Celebrate the longevity** of organizations that have helped build the field of MENA Theater.
* **Sustain the creation and presentation of works** by MENA artists and arts organizations.
* **Build the capacity** of MENA theater organizations and artists.
* **Support the creative expression** of artists that exhibit a high level of artistic excellence and innovation.
* **Empower MENA artists and arts organizations** in their efforts to promote social justice and social change through the arts.
* **Strengthen communities** by investing in cultural assets and human and MENA social capital in the U.S.

## Cohort Model

In addition to funding, grantees will also be invited to participate in a cohort engagement model, expanding MENATMA’s national community of peer organizations and artists. This cohort will foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and mutual support among those committed to sustaining and creating theater by MENA artists and serving our diaspora MENA communities.

* MENATMA will host virtual networking sessions through the grant period to provide space for organizations to exchange ideas, share resources, and build connections.
* All grantees will be invited and given financial support to attend MENATMA’s next biannual convening which is scheduled in San Francisco in Fall 2026.
* In addition, MENATMA staff and/or board members will offer one-on-one check-ins with each grantee to provide personalized support throughout the grant program.
