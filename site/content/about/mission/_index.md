## Our Mission  

MENA Theater Makers Alliance amplifies the voices of Middle Eastern and North African theater makers and expands how stories from and about our communities are told on U.S. stages. We will take space, make opportunities, champion artists, and build relationships with other marginalized communities and allies to build a more vibrant American theater.  

## Guiding Principles  

We believe the rich tapestry of American theater must reflect this nation’s true diversity, and nuanced representations of MENA perspectives must be a vital part of cultural production in the U.S.  
 
We believe that the American theatre must reject cultural conflation, and lift up the complicated and intersectional reality of MENA communities.  
 
We believe that our work in the American theater is part of a larger movement towards inclusion and equity.
