heading: MENA Theater Makers Alliance amplifies the voices of Middle Eastern and North African theater makers and expands how stories from and about our communities are told on U.S. stages.
intro: >
  We believe the rich tapestry of American theater must reflect this nationâ€™s true diversity, and nuanced representations of MENA perspectives must be a vital part of cultural production in the U.S.  


  We take space, make opportunities, champion artists, and build relationships with other marginalized communities and allies to build a more vibrant American theater.
