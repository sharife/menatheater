      text: "**Seda Iranian Theatre Ensemble** was founded in 2019 as the first
        Iranian theatre company in Seattle, USA. We named our ensemble Seda –
        which means ‘voice’ in Persian – because we believe that every human has
        a voice, and every voice deserves to be heard. We chose the name Seda as
        we aim to create an opportunity for refugees and immigrants whose voice
        cannot be heard.  In a world where the powerful majority controls the
        mainstream media and is the dominating voice, theatre is an incredible
        place to be seen and heard. Theatre is created out of nothing: all it
        takes is a viewer and a performer. The stage could be a house, a
        performance hall, an alley, or an abandoned warehouse. At Seda Theatre,
        we want to amplify and give voice to the issues and stories of
        immigrants by creating work on stage and through imagination and art. We
        will teach and learn."
