        Dunya Productions creates art and performance that will inspire and
        impassion our audience to engage with the global struggle for social and
        political justice. We seek to amplify the voices of the Middle East,
        North African, and Arab (MENAA+) people as well as other marginalized
        communities.


        We are using our group’s diversity and extensive theatre and production skills to create a new voice in Seattle. Dunya Productions looks forward to engaging the Seattle community and beyond by producing and creating provocative pieces and supporting the development of new works.
